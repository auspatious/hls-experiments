# Exploring HLS data

For now, just one notebook exploring the use of NASA's
[Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2](https://hls.gsfc.nasa.gov/) data.

This is loading data directly from Earth Data, and you need
to have a token exported as an environment variable called
`EARTHDATA_TOKEN`. You can get a token from your
[profile](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/profile) when you're logged
in on the "Generate Token" tab.
